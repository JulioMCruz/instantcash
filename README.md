# InstantCash
We're excited to introduce InstantCash, a decentralized finance (DeFi) solution that allows users to buy now and pay later with ETH collateral from Coinbase.com. Our project is designed for users from emerging markets, such as Latin America, Africa, and Asia, who may not have access to traditional credit scoring methods. InstantCash is a fully trustless DeFi protocol that requires no credit score check, making it accessible to a wider range of users.

## Project Overview
InstantCash is a DeFi buy now pay later platform that allows users to make online purchases using their ETH as collateral. The platform provides an instant credit with a payment plan of four monthly payments with 1% of interest per month. There are no hidden fees, and the protocol is sponsoring the gas fees, making it a low-cost solution for users. Our project aims to provide quick financing to individuals in emerging markets, where traditional financial services are often inaccessible or unfair.

## Problem Statement
Traditional financial services in emerging markets often lack accessibility and fairness, particularly for individuals without credit scores. Our project addresses this issue by leveraging the power of DeFi to provide a trustless, transparent, and efficient solution.

## Inspiration
